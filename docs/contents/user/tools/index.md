# **Tools**

## Basic

The ["Basic"](basic/index.md) tools module includes a set of functions to manipulate and examine molecular
systems.

## Build

The ["Build"](build/index.md) tools module is composed of functions to build and complete molecular
systems.

## Topology

In the ["Topology"](topology/index.md) tools module, a set of functions to explore the topology of a molecular system is
found.

## Structure

The ["Structure"](structure/index.md) tools module contains a set of functions to explore and manipulate the structures of a
molecular system.


## Periodic boundary conditions

Functions to work with the periodic boundary conditions of a molecular system are found in the
tools module named ["Periodic boundary conditions"](pbc/index.md).

## Molecular mechanics

In the ["Molecular mechanics"](molecular_mechanics/index.md) tools module, a set of functions to work the molecular mechanics of a molecular system is
found.

## Element

The ["Element"](element/index.md) tools module contains functions to work with the different elements of a molecular
system.

## Thirds

To work with third libraries in your workflows, MolSysMT includes the ["Thirds"](thirds/index.md) module with useful functions
implemented to their use easier.
